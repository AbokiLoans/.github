# Aboki (Staked Loans)

**aboki.eth** is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to provide flexible, asset-backed financial solutions tailored to the economic challenges in Africa. Through aboki.eth, users can stake digital assets and access fiat loans equivalent to the market value of their staked assets, helping them meet financial obligations while retaining the ability to reclaim their assets and staking rewards upon repayment.

## How It Works

Users on aboki.eth can:
- **Stake assets** on their preferred blockchain networks—Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Celo, Arbitrum, Gnosis, and Optimism—without needing to switch networks.
- **Borrow fiat loans** based on the current market value of their staked assets for a small fee over a set period.
- **Reclaim assets and rewards** upon full loan repayment, giving them flexibility to achieve their financial goals.

### Pilot Phase

In the pilot phase, we are using a Safe smart contract with a 4/5 threshold, where liquidity providers and team members serve as signers. This initial safe has allowed us to disburse over $1,062 in active loans, and transactions can be tracked on [Zapper](https://zapper.xyz/account/0x4759ef954db2b3a80c141e0a9cf099918226c868).

## Development and Future Plans

Our team is actively developing a new smart contract and frontend to support core dApp features—staking, borrowing, and loan redemption. While still in early development, this update is being tested locally in Nigeria.
